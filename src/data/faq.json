    "icon": "⚡",
    "content": "SSG (Static Site Generation) pre-builds pages at build time for maximum performance, while SSR (Server-Side Rendering) generates pages on each request for dynamic content. Astro supports both approaches, letting you choose the best strategy for each page."

    "icon": "🛣️",
    "content": "Dynamic routing in Astro uses file-based routing with square brackets like [id].astro. You can use getStaticPaths() to pre-generate static pages or enable SSR for truly dynamic routes. This allows for flexible URL structures and content management."
